# Exploring Factors Influencing Survival on the Titanic Using Python

## Introduction
There were 2224 passengers and crew members on the Titanic that sank in 1912. Of those on board, 1502 survived. In this project we are going to use data provided by [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic) to see which demographics were more likely to survive the crash. There are two parts to this projects. In the [first part](#), the dataset was cleaned up and prepared for further analysis. In the [second part](#), we took a deeper dive into the data and performed some explantory analysis.

## Dataset
The data sets consist of an ID column, a response variable and various features. This is the information provided by the source:
- `PassengerId`: unique number for each passenger;
- `Survived`: 1 if passenger survived the disaster, 0 otherwise (reponse variable);
- `Pclass`: ticket class (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd);
- `Sex`: sex of the passenger;
- `Age`: age in years;
- `SibSp`: number of siblings/spouses aboard the Titanic;
- `Parch`: number of parents/children aboard the Titanic;
- `Ticket`: ticker number;
- `Fare`: passenger fare;
- `Cabin`: cabin number;
- `Embarked`: port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton).

Some columns were added during the project:
